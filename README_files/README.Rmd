# r-regression-tools

This is a collection of functions I've built to make my life easier when
performing regressions in r


## `all_pairs()`

When investigating marginal effects, we're often only interested in the first-order
effects, i.e. those between two variables only. 

That means that if we have three variables A, B and C, we're not interested in A*B*C. However, when we've got lots of variables, it can take a long time to write out our function with each pair e.g. output ~ A + B + C + A*B + B+C + C*B and quickly gets worse as we increase the number of variables. 

`all_pairs()` writes the formula for us automatically:

```{r all_pairs}
  variables <- c("A", "B", "C", "D")
  my_output = "Output"
  all_pairs(my_output, variables)
```
